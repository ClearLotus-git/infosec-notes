# SOC Analyst Cheatsheet – Useful Things to Remember

A quick reference for essential skills and concepts every SOC analyst should remember while on the job.

##  Common Log Sources & What to Look For

| Log Source     | What to Monitor                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Windows Event  | Logon events (4624, 4625), process creation (4688) |
| Linux Syslog   | SSH attempts, sudo usage               |
| Firewall Logs  | Blocked/allowed traffic, port scans    |
| DNS Logs       | Suspicious domains, exfil over DNS     |
| Web Server     | Unusual URLs, SQLi attempts, large POSTs|

SOC Analyst Command Line & tcpdump Cheatsheet
============================================

1. Network Monitoring Commands

- tcpdump – Packet Capture
  Capture all traffic on interface eth0:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0

  Capture only TCP traffic on port 80 (HTTP):
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 80

  Capture and write to a file:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

  Read from a capture file:
    tcpdump -r capture.pcap

  Capture only packets from a specific IP:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 src 192.168.1.10

- netstat – Network Connections & Ports
  Show all active connections and listening ports:
    netstat -tulnp

  Show all TCP connections:
    netstat -at

  Show all UDP connections:
    netstat -au

- ss – Socket Statistics (Replacement for netstat)
  Show listening ports:
    ss -tuln

  Show all TCP connections with process info:
    ss -tp

- lsof – List Open Files / Network Connections
  Show open network connections:
    sudo lsof -i -n -P

  Show processes using a specific port (e.g., 443):
    sudo lsof -i :443

- ps – Process Status
  List all processes:
    ps aux

  Search for a specific process (e.g., ssh):
    ps aux | grep ssh

- top / htop – Real-time Process Monitoring
  Run top (built-in):
    top

  Run htop (if installed):
    htop

- grep – Search in Logs
  Search for “error” in syslog:
    grep "error" /var/log/syslog

  Search for failed ssh logins:
    grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

- journalctl – View Systemd Logs
  Show all logs:
    sudo journalctl

  Show recent kernel messages:
    sudo journalctl -k

  Show logs for a specific service (e.g., ssh):
    sudo journalctl -u ssh.service

2. Quick tcpdump Filters to Remember

Filter Example                   | Description
-------------------------------|-----------------------------
tcp port 443                   | HTTPS traffic
udp port 53                   | DNS queries
src 10.0.0.5                  | Traffic from source IP 10.0.0.5
dst 192.168.1.100             | Traffic to destination IP 192.168.1.100
icmp                          | Ping / ICMP traffic
tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0  | TCP SYN packets (connection attempts)

3. Pro Tips for SOC Analysts

- Use `tcpdump -c 100` to capture just 100 packets to keep file size manageable.
- Combine tcpdump with Wireshark for deep packet analysis.
- Use grep and journalctl for quick log filtering.
- Use ss over netstat for better performance on modern Linux systems.
- Always check processes behind suspicious connections with lsof or ps.

Wireshark & Packet Analysis Cheatsheet
======================================

1. Basic Filters (Display Filters)

- ip.addr == 192.168.1.5  
  Show all packets to or from IP 192.168.1.5

- ip.src == 10.0.0.1  
  Show packets where source IP is 10.0.0.1

- ip.dst == 8.8.8.8  
  Show packets where destination IP is 8.8.8.8

- tcp.port == 80  
  Show all TCP traffic on port 80 (HTTP)

- udp.port == 53  
  Show all UDP DNS traffic

- dns  
  Show only DNS protocol packets

- http  
  Show only HTTP traffic

- ssl or tls  
  Show SSL/TLS encrypted traffic

- tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0  
  Show TCP SYN packets (connection attempts)

2. Common Wireshark Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl + E  
  Start/Stop capture

- Ctrl + F  
  Find packets (search by string or hex)

- Ctrl + Shift + I  
  Open Capture Interfaces

- Ctrl + H  
  Show/Hide packet details pane

- Ctrl + Shift + S  
  Save capture file

3. Important Packet Details to Check

- Source and Destination IP and Ports  
- Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)  
- Flags (TCP SYN, ACK, FIN, RST)  
- Packet length  
- DNS Queries and Responses  
- HTTP Request Methods (GET, POST)  
- TLS Handshake and Certificates (look for Server Hello)  
- Any suspicious payloads or anomalies

4. Tips for Packet Analysis

- Use color coding (Wireshark has built-in color rules for HTTP, DNS, TCP errors)  
- Follow TCP streams: Right-click on a packet → “Follow” → “TCP Stream” to see full conversation  
- Use “Statistics” → “Protocol Hierarchy” for protocol distribution overview  
- Use “Statistics” → “Endpoints” to see talkers on the network  
- Use “Analyze” → “Expert Info” to find warnings or anomalies  

5. Export & Save

- Export specific packets: File → Export Specified Packets  
- Save capture for later: File → Save As → choose .pcapng format

Keep practicing with real captures to sharpen your skills!
